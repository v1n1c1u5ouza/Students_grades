# My First C# Code

This is my first C# code project. I'm just getting started with C# programming and this project serves as a learning experience. 

## Description

In this project, I've written a basic C# program that calculates and displays the grades of four students based on their test scores. I'm exploring C# and learning about variables, arrays, functions, and conditional statements.
